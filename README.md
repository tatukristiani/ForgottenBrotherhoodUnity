# ForgottenBrotherhoodUnity

## This project was a part of Metropolia's course, where the main goal was to build a simple game in a 4 months time.

The project's should've had 3-4 people working on the game, but my team members weren't active until the last week of this project. So about 90% of it is made by me.

This was the first game I developed.
